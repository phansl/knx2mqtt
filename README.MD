# knx2mqtt

This project is intended to push KNX telegrams to a mqtt message broker.

It is in a very early stage, the code is ugly, but works quite well. It's main goal was to test, if the calimero library has all the features i'll need to develop my home automation solution.
A build pipeline will be ramped up, tests will be added. SOON!
